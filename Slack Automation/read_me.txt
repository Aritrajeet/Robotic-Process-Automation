This flow is for creating a slack channel and add bunch of members to the channel using automation.
This process involves 3 steps:
1) Taking user inputs like Channel name, User data directory for opening browser, slack profile link, excel path link and file name where the email addresses of the members who need to join the channel are present.
2) Creating the channel based on user inputs using automated button clicks and texts.
3) Adding the members after reading the excel file row by row and then finish the process.
